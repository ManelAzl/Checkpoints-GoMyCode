Step-by-Step Process
2. Create a New GitHub Repository
Don't initialize with README (if you already have local files)
Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH)
3. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
# Add the remote GitHub repository (replace URL with yours)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
4. Push Your Files
# Stage your files
git add .  # Adds all files
# OR
git add filename.txt  # Adds specific file
# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Push to GitHub (main branch)
git push -u origin main
Subsequent Pushes (After Initial Setup)
# Just these three commands after making changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
